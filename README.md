# Django-Learning


## Getting Started (For Linux)

#### Global Install from Packages
If you wish to install Django using the Ubuntu repositories, the process is very straightforward.

First, update your local package index with apt:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

Next, check which version of Python you have installed.
```bash
$ python3 -V
```

Next, install Django:
```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-django
```

You can test that the installation was successful by typing:
```bash
$ django-admin --version
```
```bash
Output
1.11.11
```
